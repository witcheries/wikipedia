It was sculpted by Anthony de Francisci, following sketches by an unknown artist from the U.S. state of Maine. Officials in Maine wanted a commemorative half dollar to circulate as an advertisement for the centennial of the state's admission to the Union, and of the planned celebrations. Congress passed authorizing legislation without opposition. The Commission of Fine Arts urged changes in the design, but Maine officials insisted. The state decided to sell the coins at $1, double face value. Fifty thousand pieces, half the authorized mintage, were struck for release to the public, though they were issued too late to be sold at the centennial celebrations in Portland.
